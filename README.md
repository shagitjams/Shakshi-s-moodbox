 Shakshitha's Moodbox 
A cute, floating desktop widget designed to match your vibe and boost your productivity. Built with Electron.js and featuring custom hand-drawn assets.

🎨 The 5 Aesthetic Modes
Each mode transforms the widget’s UI and provides a specific tool tailored to your current emotion:

⚡ Energized (Retro-Futurism): Features a neon glow and a "Daily Win" tracker to lock in your main goal.

☁️ Overwhelmed (Mixed Media): A calming scrapbook style with a guided breathing circle to help you ground yourself.

🎨 Creative (Y2K Iridescent): A bright, colorful interface with a random palette generator for design inspiration.

💻 Focused (Tech Terminal): A high-contrast "Matrix" style focus timer for deep work sessions.

✨ Dreamy (Vintage): A soft, paper-textured digital sticky note for jotting down midnight thoughts or future ideas.

🚀 Technical Highlights
Frameless UI: Designed to sit on your desktop as a floating widget without standard window borders.

Draggable Interface: Move the widget anywhere on your screen by clicking and dragging the background.

Custom Assets: All sticker icons were hand-drawn and exported as transparent PNGs to maintain a unique "scrapbook" feel.

Dynamic Theming: Uses CSS variables and JavaScript to swap fonts, colors, and layouts instantly.
